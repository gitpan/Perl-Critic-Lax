=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Lax::ProhibitEmptyQuotes::ExceptAsFallback - empty quotes are okay as the fallback on the rhs of ||

=head1 VERSION

version 0.009

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sure, C<""> can be confusing when crammed into the middle of a big list of
values, and a bunch of spaces is even worse.  It's really common, though, to
write this code to get a default, false, defined string:

  my $value = $got || '';

It's got a certain charm about it that just isn't manifested by these:

  my $value = $got || $EMPTY;
  my $value = $got || q{};

This policy prohibits all-whitespace strings constructed by single or double
quotes, except for the empty string when it follows the high-precedence "or" or "defined or" operators.
